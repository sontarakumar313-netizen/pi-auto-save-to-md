/**
 * pi-auto-save-to-md (from pi-auto-save-to-markdown; see UPSTREAM.md)
 *
 * Automatically saves the current conversation to a markdown file after every
 * completed agent turn, with session metadata in a YAML frontmatter block.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *
 * - Trigger: `agent_settled` — fires once per user prompt, after the turn is
 *   fully done (including automatic retries and compaction), so each save
 *   captures a settled state of the conversation.
 * - Skip rule: every automatic path (the `agent_settled` save and the batch
 *   command's live save) skips sessions Pi does not persist — no session
 *   file, i.e. an in-memory SessionManager (`--no-session`): those are
 *   ephemeral auxiliary agents host clients spawn next to the real
 *   conversation (Claudian's title generation, instruction refinement,
 *   inline edits) or one-shot `pi --no-session` runs, not project
 *   conversations, and archiving them would mint junk "User's request …"
 *   files. The manual /save-conversation command still saves such a session
 *   on explicit demand; the batch never sees them (no jsonl on disk).
 * - Location: a subfolder of the session's working directory (`ctx.cwd`, the
 *   directory the session was started in), defaulting to `ai-conversations`.
 *   Override with the PI_SAVE_CONVERSATION_DIR environment variable; set it to
 *   "." or "" to save directly into the working directory.
 * - Filename: `<title>-<key>-<time>.md`, where <title> is the session name
 *   (or a slug of the first user message when unnamed), <key> is the first
 *   8 hex of the SHA-256 of the session id (the same value for every file
 *   of one session, so a session's files cluster in the archive directory
 *   across recoveries and resumes; when no session id exists yet — the
 *   degenerate fallback — the deepest message entry's id is hashed the
 *   same way, so the key is always an opaque 8-hex cluster key), and
 *   <time> is the local file-creation timestamp (YYYYMMDD-HHmmss).
 * - Frontmatter: title, agent (generator identity, always "pi" here — agent
 *   plugins for other runtimes would write their own value), format_version
 *   (the document format of the last write — additive frontmatter fields
 *   never bump it; see FORMAT_VERSION), session id, session key (the
 *   filename key), branch last entry id (field `branch_last_entry_id` — the
 *   id of the deepest message entry on the saved branch: the file's position
 *   in the session jsonl tree at the last write, scoped to this file's
 *   branch, not the session-wide last entry), model, provider, cumulative
 *   cost and tokens (input, output,
 *   cache read/write), message count, created/updated timestamps (tz-aware
 *   ISO 8601 in the local timezone with its numeric UTC offset, e.g.
 *   "2026-08-29T13:05:12+08:00"), project root and session file.
 * - Body format: every message block opens with a setext-H1 info header
 *   (`User <span …>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</span>` /
 *   `Assistant <span …>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS · model</span>`, where the span
 *   renders the metadata as small faint text — Obsidian CSS variables, so it
 *   degrades gracefully elsewhere — underlined with `===`, distinct from the
 *   `#`/`##` ATX headings AI content uses) and ends with a `---` separator
 *   wrapped in single blank lines.
 * - Tool call/result folding: calls live in the assistant entry while their
 *   results are separate toolResult entries; saves pair them by toolCall id
 *   and fold each assistant block's calls, with their FULL results, into one
 *   collapsed Obsidian callout (`> [!quote]- Tool Calls · …`). Thinking folds
 *   the same way into `> [!tldr]- Thinking`. Callouts are used instead of
 *   HTML `<details>` because Obsidian's views render embedded markdown
 *   inside HTML blocks unreliably, while callouts fold and render markdown
 *   in both Live Preview and Reading view. Outside Obsidian the callouts
 *   degrade to plain blockquotes. Arguments render as full JSON in inline
 *   code spans and results verbatim — whitespace intact, nothing capped —
 *   in fenced code blocks (delimiters sized to survive backticks inside the
 *   content), so raw output renders literally instead of being parsed as
 *   markdown. Nothing is truncated because the file is a documentary record
 *   that may be @-referenced back into a conversation: a half result is
 *   wasted when the tool is called again and misleading when it is not,
 *   while local reading (grep, ranged reads) makes size a non-issue. A
 *   result whose call was saved in an earlier file (mid-turn manual save)
 *   renders as a standalone block with the same full content.
 * - Injected prompt blocks: the host client and the agent runtime append
 *   machine-readable XML to user messages — the editor's active selection
 *   (CDATA content), note references and attachments (linked_note /
 *   linked_content), loaded skills, and their kin. Raw markup is noise
 *   Obsidian cannot render (unknown tags are not HTML; CDATA is XML), so
 *   every block in a known vocabulary is re-rendered generically (see
 *   markdown.ts) — no per-tag formatting: the callout title is the tag name
 *   in words, the body opens with vault-shaped path/location values as
 *   bare wikilinks (the aliased filename is self-explanatory — a `path:`
 *   label is noise) followed by the remaining attributes as
 *   "**name**: value" lines, then the content (the client's `]]>`
 *   split-escaping reversed). Every callout is preset-collapsed: visible
 *   blocks (selections, note references, attachments) as `> [!quote]-`,
 *   whether they carry content or only attributes (the client emits note
 *   references as self-closing tags whose whole payload is a path
 *   attribute), agent-side traces (skills) as a `> [!note]- Skill · <name>`
 *   marker — the loaded skill's name rides the title so the collapsed
 *   marker still says which skill, the location follows in the body, the
 *   content is dropped — and consecutive visible same-tag blocks (nothing
 *   but whitespace between them) merge into one callout, so a run of note
 *   references collapses into a single list (skill markers never merge:
 *   each names its own skill). Title
 *   derivation strips every known block — the typed message is the title.
 *   Unknown markup is left verbatim so XML pasted as content is never
 *   mangled.
 * - Branching: each file records exactly ONE branch (the root→leaf path
 *   returned by sessionManager.getBranch()). State is persisted via
 *   `pi.appendEntry()` custom entries, which are part of the session tree
 *   itself — they are not sent to the LLM and not rendered in the TUI. State
 *   discovery reads those entries straight from the session jsonl on disk
 *   (the shared append log is the single source of truth), so a warm process
 *   whose in-memory tree lags behind still sees states recorded by other
 *   runtimes; the in-memory tree is only a fallback when the file is
 *   unavailable. Every save ranks the recorded states whose saved position
 *   lies on the current path — deepest first, and among equal positions the
 *   state recorded LAST wins: it names the file the latest successful save
 *   actually wrote, older ones name superseded files. If the tree moved
 *   elsewhere (e.g. /tree navigation followed by a new prompt), no position
 *   matches and a new file is created with the full current branch, with an
 *   info notice naming the earlier branch's kept file so the switch stays
 *   visible in the archive. Continuing an existing branch appends only the
 *   messages that are new since the last save.
 * - Recovery: candidates are validated newest-first — the target file must
 *   exist AND its frontmatter `messages` count must cover the messages
 *   already saved for this branch (a count that exceeds it is fine — a
 *   descendant branch extended the same file); the first candidate that
 *   passes is continued. If the newest candidate fails but an older one
 *   validates, the save downgrades to the older file and warns about it
 *   (converging on existing files instead of minting new ones). Only when
 *   every candidate fails — deleted files, or files rewritten from a
 *   different tree position (e.g. /tree navigation plus a save on an older
 *   branch), where continuing could silently strand this branch's newer
 *   messages — is a brand-new file with the full current branch written.
 *   Recoveries and downgrades are never silent: each is reported as a
 *   warning naming the failed target and the likely cause (something
 *   moving/deleting files for a missing target; a concurrent runtime or an
 *   older extension version for a count mismatch). A fresh file never
 *   overwrites an existing filename either (-1, -2 … suffixes claim a free
 *   one): two runtimes recovering the same lost file in the same second
 *   would otherwise mint the same name and silently overwrite each other.
 *   Every branch therefore always ends up with a complete, consistent file.
 * - Rename-on-title: the first save usually happens before the session has
 *   its real name (Claudian generates the title only after the first reply),
 *   so the file is created with a slug of the first user message. Once the
 *   name exists, the next save renames that file exactly once, to
 *   "<name>-<key>-<original-timestamp>.md" — the original timestamp keeps
 *   the file's birthday (and makes concurrent or retried renames converge
 *   on one name), the frontmatter title and the document heading are
 *   rewritten to match, and the state entry records the new name with
 *   titled=true. One-way and one-time: a later user /name change never
 *   touches the filename, and legacy files (state entries predating the
 *   titled flag) are only renamed when their name segment equals the
 *   recomputed fallback slug, so manually organized filenames stay
 *   untouched. A rename never overwrites an existing target (-1, -2 …
 *   suffixes); a failed rename keeps the old filename — the title fields
 *   were already fixed — and retries on the next save.
 * - Mixed versions: every state entry records its save-state schema version
 *   ("MAJOR.MINOR", numbered independently of the package version) plus the
 *   writer's package version. A warm process can outlive a package upgrade
 *   and keep running pre-upgrade code against the same session; when a save
 *   sees state entries written by a NEWER schema, it warns (once per
 *   session) to restart. Older or unknown schemas are ignored — they are
 *   indistinguishable from this session's own pre-upgrade history.
 * - Compaction: files archive the ORIGINAL messages (getBranch() returns the
 *   raw tree path, not the compaction-aware context), so a compacted session
 *   still exports its complete history.
 * - Thinking repair: reasoning blocks stored with the upstream
 *   newline-fragmentation corruption (one word per line) are detected and
 *   re-joined into flowing text before saving, keeping paragraph breaks
 *   where they survive as long separator runs after sentence ends; clean
 *   thinking is untouched.
 *
 * Manual commands:
 * - `/save-conversation` saves the current branch immediately and reports
 *   the file path.
 * - `/save-conversation-all` saves EVERY session of the current project
 *   (every session jsonl in the project's `~/.pi/agent/sessions` folder):
 *   each session through the exact same pipeline — state candidates, the
 *   never-overwrite guard, rename-on-title, recovery warnings — with its
 *   archive written under that session's own working directory. Sessions
 *   without an assistant reply are skipped; the current session saves
 *   through the normal live path first. Idempotent: re-running continues
 *   or reports "up to date" per session, never re-creating files. A session
 *   whose jsonl changes while it is being processed (it is still being
 *   written by its own runtime) is deferred to the next run instead of
 *   racing the other writer — the save only proceeds when the file is
 *   verified unchanged since it was read (optimistic concurrency control;
 *   the state line the batch appends to a foreign session jsonl is
 *   byte-identical to what pi's own appendCustomEntry would write).

// ---------- thinking fragmentation repair ----------

/**
 * Some upstream reasoning streams (observed with z-ai/GLM via OpenRouter) store

 * survive only as leading spaces of the fragments. The saved markdown then has
 * every token on its own line, which is miserable to read and bloats storage.
 *
 * Detection uses two signatures validated against ~520 real thinking blocks:

 * fragments carry no leading space). Clean thinking never matches either.

 * Repair re-joins the fragments into flowing text. Word separators — the
 * whitespace runs between two fragments — lose their newlines: run length
 * alone carries no recoverable meaning, because the same word separator
 * appears as 1, 2 or 3 newlines depending on the block. Original paragraph
 * boundaries survive as a faint but strong signal: a separator run of 3+
 * newlines that follows a sentence-final character (closing quotes and
 * brackets skipped when looking) marks a real paragraph break 73–93% of the
 * time in corrupted blocks, while plain word separators sit mid-sentence —
 * so exactly those separators become blank-line paragraph breaks and
 * everything else is joined. The sentence-final guard means a break is never
 * inserted mid-sentence: worst case, one lands between two complete
 * sentences, which still reads fine. Join spacing comes from the separator
